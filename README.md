# Traffic Racer 2D â€“ Web-Based Game Project
Traffic Racer 2D is a browser-based 2D racing game that delivers a fun and engaging user experience. Built using modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (or frameworks like React or Phaser.js), the game places players behind the wheel on a crowded highway where they must dodge oncoming traffic and race for the highest score.

Designed to be lightweight, responsive, and mobile-friendly, the game also supports real-time score tracking and updates using AJAX calls, enabling dynamic communication with the backend without page reloads.
